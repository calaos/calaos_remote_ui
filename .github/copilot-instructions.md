# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods for C++ code
- Use snake_case for variables, functions, and methods for C code
- In C and C++ always append openning { on a new line
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants in #define in C
- Use PascalCase for class names in C++
- All comments should be in English and should be clear and concise and only used when necessary
- In if, for, while, and switch statements, single-line statements should not use braces, but multi-line statements should always use braces

## Error Handling
- Always log errors with contextual information
- Do not use exceptions in C++ code, use return codes instead
